# Intune Examples for Custom Compliance and Detection/Remediation with Dell Clients

This repository includes some examples to manage Dell Clients with Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Sample scripts are written in PowerShell that illustrates the usage of these scripts with UEM management and dashboarding and analytics platforms to provide various data elements from Dell client tools or OS.

Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the infrastructure to manage the data and operations on Windows based operating systems.

PowerShell offers cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework through command-line instructions and scripting language.

Most of the Dell commercial client systems are Windows-based, WMI and PowerShell are available in the IT infrastructure. This allows the IT professionals to integrate the scripts with their existing infrastructure or develop custom scripts based on their requirements. Microsoft has done a great job enhancing the PowerShell capabilities to integrate and manage WMI infrastructure.

The Dell commercial client BIOS offers configurable entities through WMI, and the script library provides sample scripts to accomplish the tasks. This method configures the Dell business client systems that contain the common interface across multiple brands, including Latitude, OptiPlex, Precision, and XPS laptops. It enhances the hardware management features and does not change across the various versions of the Windows operating systems.

Microsoft Intune
Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that focuses on Mobile Device Management (MDM). For more details on Microsoft Intune, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune]

Deploying a PowerShell script from Intune
The Microsoft Intune management extension allows you to upload the PowerShell scripts in Intune. You can run these scripts on the systems which are running on Windows 10 operating systems. The management extension enhances the Mobile Device Management (MDM) capabilities. For more information about Deploying a PowerShell script from Intune, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/intune-management-extension]

Client script library
This GitHub library offers the PowerShell scripts that illustrate the usage of the agentless BIOS manageability to perform the following 


#Remediation/Detection operations:

Configure BIOS passwords  -  Setting Admin PW on machines without AdminPW

Configure BIOS attribute(s) - Setting Fastboot and Thermal Settings

Configure BIOS Password change after specific time - helping Admin to renew BIOS Admin PW on a regular base

Checking/update missing critical drivers - Using Dell Command Update to identify devices with critical driver updates missing

Checking/Configure Display settings - Usind Dell Display Manager to set ComfortView on Dell Displays

Checking Dell SafeBIOS status - Using Trusted Device Agent to identify devices where BIOS settings need to change for Idicators of Attack requirements

Checking Warrenty Time - Using Dell Command Monitor for check duration time of warranty and inform user by notification if it less 45 days


#Custom Compliance:
Checking Support Contract - Checikg with Dell CommaÂ´nd Monitor rest time of support

Checking Dell SafeBIOS - Using Dell Trusted Device Security Assesement to check all security values of a device

Checking missing critical drivers - Using Dell Command Update to identify devices with critical driver updates missing

Checking chassis intrusion - Using Dell Command Monitor to check if device chassis was opened
